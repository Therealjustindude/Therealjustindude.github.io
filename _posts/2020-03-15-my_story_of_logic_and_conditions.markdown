	“We are, as a species, addicted to story. Even when the body goes to sleep, the mind stays up all night, telling itself stories.” — Jonathan Gottschall, The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human. We can learn with logic how to navigate through conditionals by listening to others stories. Also, story is a great way to teach logic and conditions. Logic and conditions help you create metaphors for life. Example, If  hungry a search for food will occur. Many conditions can pop up during a search for food. The logic you use when encountering those conditions is what helps navigate the story to an end.
	
 	I started FlatIron School with a growth mind set. Telling my self a story. It goes like this: If I am struggling to understand something I will keep my inner dialogue positive. I will use all my resources(curiosity, ask for help, prioritize, google) and turn mistakes into growth opportunities. If I don’t find answers, I will not give up, I will loop back to the beginning. 
	
	At the end of week three I wasn’t keeping pace and I wasn’t retaining the course material. I started to feel anxious and my inner dialogue was negative. I walked away from the computer and pouted my way to bed. I mentioned my inner dialogue was negative so in bed I was beating my self up. Questioning my decisions, my work ethic and my values. This was a loop I was familiar with. So i’m in that moment of fixed mindset and negative talk when I remember that I know how this story ends. I give up. But, I had put some logic in place for this exact moment. 
	
	The logic to get me out of this negative loop is simple, just exit the loop. I exit the loop by telling my self I am a new person. A person who won’t quit when things get hard. I had a real talk with myself: “You’re not putting in the work. You are hitting this negative loop because you are being lazy. This isn’t going to happen for you if you don’t put any effort in.” I decided the next morning I would work on prioritizing my time, ask for more help and be curious. 
	
	With out the logic learned from my previous stories I wouldn’t have stayed on path. I might have created a story where I would have looked for every short cut. Never feeling the satisfaction of solving a problem. I would have complained and made stories to validate those complaints. I don’t want to be associated with that and the people who are successful wouldn’t either. If I find myself encountering that condition again I know what to do. My path is to learn, grow and become a great programmer.

  “When you die from the anxiety of something that actually turned out fine.” It seems so silly how many times I’ve let my anxiety control me. I decided to start studying software engineering to challenge myself. I’ve tried many times, using Udemy classes, but I never put in the effort it deserves. 
	
  With a fixed mind set I would freeze or give up when coding got intimidating. Failure at the time was an identity for me and not an event. I couldn't see the excitement in taking on a challenge and failing. The thought was debilitating.
	
  Having a growth mind set means I will no longer freeze or run when coding gets challenging. I understand a mistake does not mean I am a mistake. I am excited to run into my first obstacle. It's not the outcome i'm excited about it's the process. 
	
  I used to think if you have to work at it, it wasn’t meant to be. Now, Im excited for the time i’ll spend thinking of a way to phrase my question for google so I can resolve an error message. Or, the time i’ll spend fixing syntax errors. Mind set is everything. How will I handle the challenges of software engineering? With a growth mind set.
